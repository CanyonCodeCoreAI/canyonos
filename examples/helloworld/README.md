# My CanyonOS Project

A distributed agent orchestration project built with [CanyonOS](https://github.com/canyonos).

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build stubs and Docker images
canyonos build

# Launch all agents
canyonos deploy

# Test with curl
curl -X POST http://<workflow_host_ip>:8080/main \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"query": "World"}'

# Check result
curl http://<workflow_host_ip>:8080/status/<request_id>
```

```

## Adding a New Agent

1. Create `agents/my_agent.yaml` with the agent interface definition
2. Create `agents/my_agent.py` with the implementation class
3. Add the agent entry to `config/global_controller.yaml`
4. Run `canyonos build` to regenerate stubs and Docker images
5. Run `canyonos deploy` to launch

## Policy Rules

Edit `config/policy.yaml` to control which callers can access which agents.
Pass `_context` in your curl request to set the caller identity:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/main \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"query": "World", "_context": {"origin": "admin"}}'
```
