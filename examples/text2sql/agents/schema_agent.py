# Schema Retrieval Agent
#
# First stage of the NL-to-SQL pipeline. Embeds the natural-language question
# and retrieves the most relevant tables/columns from a schema index.
#
# Resource profile: GPU-bound embedding + vector search. Embeddings are highly
# batchable, so this agent is where the scheduler can coalesce work across
# concurrent requests before hitting the GPU.
