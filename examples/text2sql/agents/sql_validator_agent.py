# SQL Validator Agent
#
# Third stage. Static validation of each candidate WITHOUT executing it:
# lint/parse checks plus an EXPLAIN-style cost estimate. The cost estimate is
# the key scheduling signal — cheap queries pass straight through, expensive
# ones can be queued, batched to off-peak, or bounced back for rewriting.
#
# Resource profile: cheap CPU. High fan-out (one call per candidate), but each
# call is light, so this stage is where admission-control decisions are made.
