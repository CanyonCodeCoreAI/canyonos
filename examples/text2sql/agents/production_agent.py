# Production Executor Agent
#
# Final stage. Runs the single winning query against the big production
# warehouse, but only through a governed admission gate: queries whose
# estimated cost exceeds the budget are rejected rather than allowed to burn
# warehouse resources.
#
# Resource profile: scarce, expensive production slots. This is the resource
# the whole staged pipeline exists to protect. A statement timeout stands in
# for real preemption (killing a runaway query mid-flight).
