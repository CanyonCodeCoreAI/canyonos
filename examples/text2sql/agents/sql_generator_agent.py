# SQL Generator Agent
#
# Second stage. Given the question and the retrieved schema, generates N
# candidate SQL queries. State-of-the-art NL-to-SQL pipelines (CHASE-SQL,
# XiYan-SQL) generate several candidates and select among them, so this is a
# genuine fan-out.
#
# Resource profile: LLM-bound. Calls the VllmAgent remotely for each candidate.
# These calls sit on the request's critical path, so the scheduler should
# prioritize them over background work.

# `agents.vllm_agent` is where the generated VllmAgent stub actually lands
# inside this agent's own Docker container (stubs are copied to their source
# agent's own entrypoint-mirrored path -- see canyonos/stub_generator.py). The
# bare `vllm_agent` fallback covers running outside that layout.
