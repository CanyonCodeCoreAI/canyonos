# Sandbox Executor Agent
#
# Fourth stage. Runs surviving candidates against a SMALL sampled replica of
# the real dataset, then votes on the best via result self-consistency. This
# is the "test on a smaller database for correctness" step.
#
# Resource profile: a stateful, warm pool of sampled databases. Marked
# `stateful: true` in the controller config so all calls within one request_id
# route to the same instance (session affinity), which keeps the seeded sample
# warm across generate -> validate -> execute for that request.
#
# We use an in-memory SQLite DB seeded with a sample so the candidates are
# ACTUALLY executed and compared — correctness voting here is real, not faked.
