# Configure `.car/config`

**When:** before writing an agent declaration or the deployment manifest.

**Output:** one declaration per service and one reviewed
`global_controller.yaml`, with requirements derived separately for each image.

Work in this order:

1. Derive names, entrypoints, workflow path, and requirements from the service
   map and copied import graph.
2. Write each agent declaration.
3. Build the complete manifest candidate with documented defaults.
4. Review developer-owned choices through the View/Change flow.
5. Write the reviewed candidate; validate only cross-file contracts not already
   guaranteed by the config flow.

## Ownership of configuration keys

Two kinds of key share one file. A **derived** key has exactly one right answer
and the copy holds it; asking the developer can only make it worse. A
**developer** key is a deployment choice the source does not contain, and
deriving it means guessing and presenting the guess as a reading.

The configuration review shows the whole manifest and asks about the second
column only, in one round, carrying these defaults.

| Key | Decided by | Default when unanswered |
|---|---|---|
| `name`, `entrypoint`, `workflow_file`, `type` | derived — selected service map | — |
| `requirements` | derived — the entry's import graph | — |
| `provider` | developer | `local` |
| `ec2:` block, `instance_type` | developer — no default is safe | entry stays `local` |
| `replicas` | developer, *unless* cross-request state forces `1` | `1` |
| `resources.cpu` / `resources.memory` | developer | `1` / `512` MiB |
| `api_port` | developer | `8080` |
| `redis_port`, `redis.host` / `.port` / `.db` | developer | `6379`, `localhost` / `6379` / `0` |
| `poll_interval` | developer | `5` |
| `cleanup_interval` | developer | `10` |
| `env_file` | developer — the file's location and whether it exists | `.env` when the survey found credential reads, or the source calls an OpenAI/Anthropic/Bedrock model API (see `llm-proxy.md`), else absent |
| `otel.destinations` | derived for `provider: local` (see below) | the local dashboard's OTLP ingest |
| `project_id` | derived — generated once by the controller and written back into the config file | absent on first write; a generated UUID after |
| `policy.yaml` | developer | absent |

Three entries in that table are not free choices, and saying so is part of showing
the config rather than asking about it:

- **`replicas` stops being a choice once a service holds cross-request state.**
  When the survey finds such state, the service-boundary section in
  `source-survey.md` fixes `replicas: 1` as a correctness requirement. Report it as a constraint; do not offer to
  raise it. This constraint disappears if the state is moved into a declared
  `type: database` entry instead (see Database services below) -- state then
  lives outside the process, so replicas no longer share or lose anything.
- **EC2 identifiers are wrong to invent.** ec2.md forbids copying them from an
  example environment, and a wrong AMI, subnet, or security group fails at
  deploy preflight or, worse, provisions something unreachable. Unanswered
  means the entry stays `local`.
- **`otel.destinations` defaults to the local dashboard's own OTLP ingest for
  `provider: local`.** Without it, the exporter subprocess never starts and no
  trace reaches the dashboard -- expected only when the developer explicitly
  wants tracing off. Include:

  ```yaml
  otel:
    # The dashboard api's own OTLP ingest. Must be the full url including the
    # path: the http exporter uses an explicitly-passed endpoint verbatim and
    # only appends /v1/traces when reading OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT.
    destinations:
      - name: local
        protocol: http
        endpoint: http://host.docker.internal:3000/v1/traces
        headers: {}
  ```

  `host.docker.internal` names the local Docker host, not a remote one --
  read [ec2.md](ec2.md#networking) before reusing this block on an entry with
  `provider: EC2`.

Omitting `project_id` is not the same as leaving it unset: the controller
generates a UUID on first load and appends `project_id: "<uuid>"` to the
config file on disk so it survives reloads and restarts. Never invent one when
reviewing a candidate manifest -- absent means "not yet assigned", not "missing".

## Configuration review

Use the interaction implemented by `canyonos config` before writing
`.car/config/global_controller.yaml`:

1. Build the complete candidate manifest in memory from derived values and the
   defaults above.
2. **View** prints the whole candidate, annotating defaults and source-imposed
   constraints such as `replicas: 1` for in-memory state.
3. **Change** asks in one batch only for developer-owned values: provider and
   EC2 fields, unconstrained replicas, resources, ports, secret-file location,
   and access restrictions. Show each current/default value, apply answers, and
   show the result.
4. Write the reviewed candidate. Defer gap validation until runtime code and
   configuration are both complete.

Prefer running `canyonos config` when an interactive terminal is available;
otherwise reproduce View/Change in conversation. Do not ask for derived values
such as entrypoints or requirements.

An unattended `canyonos build -y` run must not block on this interaction or ask
questions. Use and report the displayed defaults. Never invent EC2
infrastructure identifiers: without them, keep the entry `local`.

## Agent declarations

Declarations go in `.car/config/`, beside the manifest. The build reads every
`*.yaml` there and keeps the ones with a top-level `agent.name`, so the
manifest and `policy.yaml` drop out on their own.

Use one yaml per deployed service. Argument types are bare builtins only:
`str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `dict`, or `list`. Every declared argument is
required by the generated stub. `returns.type` is documentation; use `dict` or
`list` to signal that workflow callers must `json.loads` the returned string.

## Database services

A `type: database` entry provisions a plain container from a public image
instead of building one from `.car/app` -- it has no `entrypoint` and no
declaration YAML. Use it when a source's state (a store, memory, or
checkpointer) must survive across replicas instead of forcing `replicas: 1`
(see `source-survey.md`). This is unrelated to the top-level `database:` key
above, which stays omitted regardless.

| Key | Meaning | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `image` | public image to pull and tag, e.g. `postgres:16-alpine` | required |
| `db_port` | host port mapped to the image's own port | `5432` |
| `volume_path` | in-container path to persist across restarts; omit to skip the volume | absent |
| `env` | env vars the image itself needs, e.g. `POSTGRES_USER` | `{}` |

Every other declared service already reaches it without extra wiring: its
resolved `host:port` is published in the same routing table every agent uses,
over the Redis connection every container already receives
(`CANYONOS_REDIS_HOST`/`CANYONOS_REDIS_PORT`).

## Per-image requirements

Each image installs the runtime's base list plus that entry's `requirements:`
and nothing else. The source's own `requirements.txt` is never installed -- the
generator writes its own, and no image runs an editable install, so the
source's own `pyproject.toml` never contributes either. Re-declare every runtime
distribution by hand, per entry.

Declare the name PyPI installs, not the name Python imports; they differ often
enough that the import graph cannot be copied verbatim. `import speech_recognition`
installs as `SpeechRecognition`, `import yaml` as `PyYAML`, `import cv2` as
`opencv-python`. An import name that does not exist on PyPI fails the image build,
not the port, so the error arrives a stage later than the mistake.

Build each entry's list from the imports its image *executes*, not from the code
you wrote:

1. Follow module-scope imports out of the entrypoint (or `workflow_file`) into
   the copy, transitively. A workflow that imports `benchmark.py`, which imports
   `agent.py`, needs `agent.py`'s distributions even though the workflow makes
   no model call.
2. Stop the walk at another service's declared `entrypoint`, and nowhere else.
   The build writes that agent's stub over exactly that path in every other
   image, so nothing behind it is executed there. A module that merely wraps a
   service is not an entrypoint: when the workflow imports
   `src/retail_adapter.py` while the manifest declares
   `entrypoint: src/retail_agent.py`, the adapter is real code in the workflow
   image and every distribution it reaches is the workflow entry's to declare.
3. Include the `__init__.py` of every package on those paths -- it runs first.
   In a peer image the entrypoint is a stub, but its package `__init__` and its
   siblings are real, so that image still installs what they import.
4. Omit distributions reachable only from source files no image imports, such as
   a Gradio or Streamlit UI beside the agent. The source-integrity boundary
   forbids reclassifying a declared dependency, not declining to ship an
   unreachable one; name what you left out in the report.

`requirements: []` on the workflow entry is the claim that its module reaches
nothing past the base list. That is true only when the workflow imports each
service from its declared `entrypoint` and names no third-party import of its
own -- not because "the workflow only runs stubs". A comment in the manifest
asserting the stub contract does not make it true, and the workflow container
is the only one serving :8080: when it dies at import, the deployment has no
HTTP entry point for its whole life.

`validate.py` walks the same graph and reports what is missing as W006.

Version them the way the source resolved them, not the way PyPI resolves them
today:

- **The source has a lockfile** (`poetry.lock`, `uv.lock`, a pinned
  `requirements.txt`): copy those exact versions. Repeating the bare names
  resolved `langchain` 1.x for one port, which no longer has
  `langchain.agents.agent_toolkits` -- the untouched source's own import.
- **The source pins nothing**: cap every fast-moving distribution below its next
  major (`langchain<1.0`, `openai<2`). Unpinned means "whatever existed when
  this was written", which is not what pip installs today. Pair each cap with a
  floor: a bound like `crewai<2.0` alone also permits every release back to the
  project's first, and pip is free to resolve one of those to satisfy some other
  entry. `crewai>=0.60,<2.0` says which era the port was written against.
- **The source predates a known SDK break**: pin contemporaneous with its last
  commit. A 2023 AutoGen script passing `request_timeout=` needs
  `pyautogen==0.1.14`, which depends on `openai<1`, not `autogen==0.7.5`, which
  floors on `openai>=1.58` where that kwarg is `timeout`. The source-integrity
  boundary forbids rewriting that call, so the pin has to absorb the
  difference. Compare the source's
  commit date against the pin's release date whenever the source hardcodes SDK
  kwargs.

Resolve the list before writing any adapter -- `uv pip compile`, or
`pip install --dry-run -r` into a scratch environment. A source whose own locked
graph is no longer installable (a yanked release series that an unconditional
transitive pin still requires) is a port blocker; one command finds it instead
of one build-fail/pin/rebuild cycle per attempt. Report it and stop rather than
upgrading the source out of the problem.
