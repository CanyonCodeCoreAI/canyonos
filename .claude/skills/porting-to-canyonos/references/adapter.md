# Implement runtime code in `.car/app`

**When:** after selecting service boundaries, before writing an adapter or
workflow.

**Output:** one loadable adapter per service and one workflow exposing
`main(query: str)`.

Use this order:

1. Choose a safe entrypoint module for each service.
2. Write a no-argument synchronous adapter around source-owned behavior.
3. Bridge async or session state only when the source requires it.
4. Write the workflow and preserve parallel dispatch.

Complete `manifest.md`, then validate only the authored contracts that CanyonOS
does not already guarantee.

These rules are required even when static checks pass; violations often appear
only when a container loads.

## Adapter and workflow shape

Write a no-argument, synchronous adapter class at the selected entrypoint.
Import source-owned behavior instead of duplicating it. The workflow exposes
`main(query: str)`, imports every service from its exact entrypoint module, and
calls `deploy(main, port=...)` at module scope. Do not add a main guard: the
workflow executes as `__main__` in production.

Its imports of the platform itself are exactly these two:

```python
from deploy import deploy                 # runtime module, copied flat into the image
from pkg.price_agent import PriceAgent    # the service, from its declared entrypoint
```

`canyonos_core` is not an importable API in the image: the package the build
writes there holds the LLM proxy alone, under an `__init__` that exports
nothing. `from canyonos_core import deploy` builds green and raises ImportError
at container start.

For parallel remote calls, dispatch all work before resolving any result:

```python
futures = [agent.work(item=item) for item in items]
results = [json.loads(future.value()) for future in futures]
```

Combining dispatch and `.value()` in one comprehension serializes the work.

## Choosing the entrypoint

The entrypoint is the one module in the copy the build destroys: each agent's
stub is written over its own `entrypoint` path in every image except that
agent's own, so everywhere else that path holds a generated class and nothing
else. Every gate below applies to whichever module you pick; each one
disqualifies it as it stands, so fix the module or point `entrypoint` at
another.

1. **Does anything else the deployment imports read this module for its real
   contents?** The workflow, or any module the workflow imports at module scope.
   If yes, the stub replaces it there and the workflow dies at container
   startup. Put the adapter in a sibling module that imports this one and point
   `entrypoint` at the sibling. This is why "edit the copied module in place" is
   a preference and not a rule: it is right only for a module nothing else
   imports.
2. **Does the module's package `__init__.py` re-export a name from it?**
   (`from .graph import graph`) Python runs `__init__.py` before any submodule,
   so every peer image that touches that package re-runs a re-export the stub
   cannot satisfy and raises ImportError at startup. Point `entrypoint` at a
   module the `__init__` does not re-export from; add one if it re-exports from
   all of them. CAR-PACKAGE-REEXPORT.
3. **Is every segment of the path a Python identifier?** `travel-planner.py` and
   `steps/06_agent.py` load fine -- the controller loads by file path -- but the
   workflow's `from steps.06_agent import X` is a SyntaxError, which no import
   guard catches. Rename the file inside the copy, or add a normally-named
   sibling that loads it by path and re-exposes the class.
4. **Does the module use relative imports?** (`from . import data_service`) The
   controller loads the entrypoint with `spec_from_file_location`, which leaves
   `__package__` empty, so every relative import *in the entrypoint itself*
   fails at agent load. Make its top-level imports absolute; the modules it
   imports keep theirs.
5. **Does module-level code perform a real run?** A script ending in
   `result = crew.kickoff(...)` / `print(result)` fires that run whenever the
   module loads, before a request exists. Delete the
   invocation and keep the construction. The source-integrity boundary in
   `preparation.md` protects prompts, tools, schemas, model calls, and node
   bodies—not a script's own main body.

## Bridging async

Use one `asyncio.run(...)` per declared method, at the method boundary, around
the whole call. One per awaited coroutine builds a fresh event loop and a fresh
connection pool per graph superstep.

If the instance holds anything bound to a loop -- an `asyncio.Lock`, a client
constructed inside a coroutine -- `asyncio.run` cannot be used at all. The
runtime calls declared methods repeatedly on one instance, and the second call
raises `Lock is bound to a different event loop`. Run one persistent loop on a
background thread and submit with `run_coroutine_threadsafe`. Seed any
`ContextVar` the source's async code reads on the calling thread immediately
before submitting: `call_soon_threadsafe` copies the context at schedule time,
not inside the loop.

## Multi-turn and session state

The platform sends one `{query: string}` per request and keeps nothing between
them. A source with per-conversation state -- a `thread_id`, a checkpointer, a
memory keyed by session -- carries that id *inside* `query`: accept either a
bare string or a JSON object in that one field and pass the id through to the
source unchanged. Do not add a second workflow parameter for it; the platform
never sends one.

That id identifies a conversation; it does not by itself make the framework's
own store/checkpointer durable across replicas. If `source-survey.md` found
one and a `type: database` entry was declared for it, construct that
store/checkpointer against the declared entry's resolved address instead of an
in-process one -- read `routing_table:endpoints` from Redis
(`CANYONOS_REDIS_HOST`/`CANYONOS_REDIS_PORT`, already in every container's env)
for the database entry's name, the same way any other declared agent's address
is resolved.
