# Prepare the `.car` artifact

**When:** before creating or refreshing `.car`, or when imports and runtime
assets need packaging decisions.

**Output:** a self-contained `.car/config` and `.car/app`, with the original
application source untouched and existing imports preserved. `.gitignore` and
the environment files are the exception -- see **Artifact boundary**.

Use this order:

1. Read **Artifact model and preparation** and choose the import root from actual
   imports.
2. Run `prepare.py`; do not recreate guarantees already enforced by the script.
3. Use **Import roots, metadata, and runtime assets** only when direct `/app`
   imports are insufficient or the source opens non-Python files.
4. Use **Refresh an existing source copy** only when `.car/app` already exists.

## Artifact model and preparation

### Product and runtime names

CanyonOS Core is the product name and `canyonos` is its user-facing CLI. The
internal Python package, environment variables, and Docker resources are
named `canyonos_core`, `CANYONOS_*`, and `canyonos-*`. These are protocol
identifiers, not CLI instructions or branding strings. Do not rename them.

### Artifact boundary

The port lives entirely inside `.car/`, next to the application source:

```text
.car/config/global_controller.yaml   deployment manifest
.car/config/policy.yaml              optional access restriction
.car/config/<name>.yaml              one callable surface per service
.car/app/                            a copy of the application source
.car/app/<dir>/<name>.py             adapter beside the code it wraps
.car/app/<dir>/<name>_workflow.py    HTTP entry point; calls deploy()
<application source>/                untouched and unaware of the port
```

`.car` has exactly two authored directories: `config/`, which holds every
Canyon-owned declaration, and `app/`, which becomes `/app` in every container.
Nothing under `.car` points back into the original source, and no application
module points at `.car`. Deleting `.car` must restore the project to its
pre-port state, save for three files the port is allowed to touch:

* `.gitignore` -- `prepare.py` appends `.car/` so the artifact stays out of the
  project's history. The script owns this line; do not write it by hand, and do
  not report it as a source modification.
* `.env` and `.env.example` -- the port's model calls reach the provider through
  the in-container proxy, so its base-URL variables live here. Append to `.env`
  without reading it: it holds the developer's real keys, and a later assignment
  beats an earlier one in both `python-dotenv` and `docker --env-file`, so the
  line you add wins outright. `.env.example` carries no secrets; read that one
  and add only what it lacks. See [llm-proxy.md](llm-proxy.md).

Nothing else outside `.car` changes.

Preserve the source's directory structure. Put adapters in the copied module
whose behavior they wrap unless the entrypoint rules require a sibling module;
do not invent generic `agents/` or `workflow/` directories. `canyonos` commands
run from the application root and read `.car` below it.

The file count follows the deployment: one yaml/adapter pair per independently
deployed service. If a copied source class already satisfies the runtime
contract, point its declaration at that class and do not add an adapter.

### Prepare the copy

Choose the source's **import root**, not automatically its repository root.
`/app` is the only source entry on `sys.path`, and no image runs an editable
install. For example, source under `src/` that says `from tools import ...`
needs the contents of `src/` copied directly into `.car/app/`. Decide from the
source's imports. Continue to **Import roots, metadata, and runtime assets** below when the
copy has those concerns.

Create the artifact with the skill script rather than ad hoc copy commands:

```bash
python3 <skill_dir>/prepare.py <import-root> .car
```

The script creates `.car/config/` and copies the import root's **contents** to
`.car/app/`. It excludes VCS data, `.car`, `.claude`, virtual environments,
caches, build outputs, bytecode, and credential-bearing `.env*` files while
retaining `.env.example`, `.env.sample`, and `.env.template`. It rejects
symbolic links: they can escape the artifact and may be skipped by runtime
source sweeps.

It also adds `.car/` to the project's `.gitignore`, creating that file if the
project has none, and does nothing when the artifact is already ignored or
nothing above it is a git work tree. The artifact is a build output of the
port, not something to commit, and `.car/app` is a second copy of the source
that would otherwise show up in every diff.

If `.car/app` already exists, follow **Refresh an existing source copy** below. Use
`--force` only when every edit in `.car/app` may be discarded; it leaves
`.car/config/` unchanged.

After preparation, edit only `.car` and survey the copy using
[source-survey.md](source-survey.md). Do not add validation for preparation
postconditions that `prepare.py` already guarantees.

### Source-integrity boundary

`canyonos validate` owns authored runtime contracts that CanyonOS tooling does
not strongly guarantee. The porter owns constraints static analysis cannot
prove:

- Never edit outside `.car`, or duplicate source-owned prompts, tools, schemas,
  model calls, parsing, retries, and node bodies in an adapter. Two files at the
  application root are the deliberate exception, each owned by a step that says
  so: `.gitignore` (`prepare.py`, above) and the deployment's `.env` /
  `.env.example` ([llm-proxy.md](llm-proxy.md)).
- Never swap providers, invent runtime configuration, or silently move, drop,
  or reclassify a dependency.
- Rewrite framework control flow only where it crosses a chosen service
  boundary; preserve it inside a service.
- Never hardcode or bake a real credential into `.car`.

When a source defect or a runtime limit requires crossing one of these
boundaries, report the blocker and obtain approval for that specific
change. Do not broaden that approval to unrelated source edits.

## Import roots, metadata, and runtime assets

### What `/app` can import

CanyonOS Core copies `.car/app/` into the image with its paths intact and
starts Python at `/app`, so `/app` is that copy. Python resolves names rooted
there:

- `/app/tools.py` as `import tools`
- `/app/pkg/__init__.py` as `import pkg`
- `/app/src/agents/...` as `import src.agents`, including PEP 420 namespace
  directories without `__init__.py`

It does not resolve `/app/source/pkg` as `import pkg`; `/app/source` must become
an import root first.

### Re-root the copy before reaching for metadata

`.car/app/` is a copy Canyon owns, so the cheapest fix is usually to root it
where the source already imports from. A project laid out as

```text
repo/src/email_assistant.py     imports `tools`, `prompts`, `utils`
repo/src/tools/
repo/pyproject.toml
```

has `src/` as its import root. Copy `src/`'s contents to `.car/app/` and every
one of those imports resolves from `/app` with no metadata, no editable install
and no `sys.path` hack. `entrypoint` and `workflow_file` then name modules
relative to that root, and the workflow imports the agent the same way.

One copy root has to serve every import. When none can -- the source imports
both `tools` and `src.tools` -- no packaging trick closes the gap; report the
blocker and stop.

### Packaging metadata is never installed

No image runs `pip install -e .`, under any provider, so a `pyproject.toml` in
the copy installs nothing and puts no package on `sys.path`. Do not author a
wrapper one to reach a nested import, and do not substitute a `sys.path` hack or
relocated source files: re-root the copy, or report the blocker.

Keep the source's own declaration unchanged and repeat its runtime
distributions in each relevant config entry's `requirements`, the only list an
image installs. This is compatibility scaffolding, not permission to drop, move,
or reclassify declared dependencies. Report declared-but-unused toolchain
dependencies and their image cost; let the owner decide whether source metadata
should change.

### Runtime data and configuration files

`prepare.py` copies non-Python files into `.car/app`, but that does not prove the
runtime's image sweep carries them into a container. Inventory every file opened
by the selected import graph: prompt templates, JSON schemas, PDFs, local
corpora, certificates, and framework configuration such as CrewAI
`agents.yaml` and `tasks.yaml`.

The image sweep carries every file, so retain each asset at the same path
relative to the chosen import root, and check any path derived from the original
repository root or the process working directory; the container starts at
`/app`.

What the sweep holds back is a class of path rather than a file type: hidden
paths, symlinks, private key material, and the names the build context owns.
An asset behind one of those never reaches the image -- move it out of the
dotted path, or report it as a runtime blocker and stop after validation. Do not
conceal the gap by base64-encoding the file into Python, changing a hardcoded
path, or duplicating framework config into adapter code; those changes restate
source-owned data and behavior.

Do not treat successful construction as evidence that configuration loaded.
Frameworks such as CrewAI may warn about a missing yaml and create an empty
configuration, then fail only when the first agent or task is accessed. Inspect
those decorators and file references statically during the survey. The build
phase of `canyonos deploy` owns packaging syntax and installation errors, so
none of this belongs in a preparation-time check.

## Refresh an existing source copy

Run the same preparation command with `--refresh` and the same import root:

```bash
python3 <skill_dir>/prepare.py <import-root> .car --refresh
```

The initial copy records source-file hashes in
`.car/config/.porting-state.json`. Refresh compares three states:

```text
previous source hash → current source
                    ↘ current .car/app
```

- Only the source changed: update `.car/app`.
- Only `.car/app` changed: preserve the port edit.
- The source added a path unused by the port: add it.
- The source deleted an unmodified path: delete it from `.car/app`.
- Both sides changed the same path differently: make no changes and report all
  conflicts.

Resolve a conflict in `.car/app`, then either make the source match that result
or intentionally start over. The script does not guess a merge because an
adapter and its source often change for different reasons while sharing one
module.

`--force` is not refresh. It discards the entire `.car/app` tree and replaces it
with a clean source copy while retaining `.car/config`. Use it only when every
adapter and workflow edit in `.car/app` is intentionally disposable.

After refresh, survey changed imports, dependencies, runtime assets, and service
boundaries again. Run `canyonos validate` for the affected authored contracts,
but do not revalidate merge mechanics already guaranteed by the successful
atomic refresh.
