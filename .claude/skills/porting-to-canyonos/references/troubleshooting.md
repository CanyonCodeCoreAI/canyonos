# Diagnose an approved deployment failure

**When:** an explicitly approved `canyonos deploy` fails during build, startup,
or a request. Do not use this table to extend the pre-deployment porting flow.

**How:** find the symptom, verify the likely cause, then follow the linked
canonical reference. For runtime mechanisms read
[runtime-contract.md](runtime-contract.md); for proxy or remote-host failures
read [llm-proxy.md](llm-proxy.md) or [ec2.md](ec2.md).

## Build or deploy stops early

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| `Application source copy not found` | The command ran somewhere other than the application root, or `.car/app/` was never created |
| `Config file not found: .car/config/...` while `.car` exists | The command ran inside `.car`; it belongs one level up |
| Agent image is missing | Config name matched no declaration in `config/`, entrypoint is absent, or build skipped it; inspect build warnings |
| Wrong declaration is used | Two files in `config/` declare the same `agent.name`; the later filename silently wins |
| Two services produce one image | Config names collide after lowercase normalization |
| `generated grpc_stubs are missing` | Build did not complete on this host, or generated output was cleaned before deploy |
| `int(... NoneType)` during local deploy | Local provider was not written exactly as lowercase `local` |
| Replica conversion `TypeError` | `replicas` is not an integer |
| Policy `AttributeError` | Policy exists but is empty or has null/non-list rules; remove it when unrestricted |
| Port or container name already in use | A previous deployment did not complete cleanup |

## Container exits or serves nothing

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| `import local_controller` raises protobuf version error | Host-generated gRPC code is newer than the image's protobuf runtime |
| First request says `No agent loaded` | Entrypoint import, class lookup, or constructor failed and the controller swallowed the exception; inspect container logs |
| Replica is healthy but serves nothing | Health publication does not prove successful agent loading |
| Missing credentials while loading | `env_file` is unset or points somewhere else, or the source reads another variable |
| Source module is missing | `.car/app` is not rooted at the source's import root, so the original import does not resolve from `/app`; read [preparation.md](preparation.md#import-roots-metadata-and-runtime-assets) |
| Third-party module is missing | Distribution is absent from source metadata and config requirements |
| Stub import raises `NameError` | yaml argument type is not a bare builtin |
| An agent runs in the workflow process instead of a container | The workflow reached the class by a module the stub does not own -- neither the agent's `entrypoint` path nor that path's basename at the context root |
| Calls to one agent reach another | Two config entries share an `entrypoint`, so one stub was written over the other |
| Runtime-named module disappears | Shared runtime copy overwrote a module at the root of the source copy with the same name |
| An application file is missing from the image | The sweep carries every file, but never a hidden path, a symlink, private key material, or a name the build context owns (`Dockerfile`, `requirements.txt`, `workflow_launcher.py`); the build prints one note per exclusion |
| Container crashes with a connection error to `localhost` for Redis, Postgres, etc. | A checkpointer/cache/store client kept the source's `localhost` default; rebuild it from `CANYONOS_REDIS_HOST`/`CANYONOS_REDIS_PORT` (or the equivalent), read [adapter.md](adapter.md#backing-services-default-to-the-wrong-host) |
| Peer container raises `ImportError` for a name in another agent's module | That agent's package `__init__.py` re-exports from its entrypoint, which is a stub in this image; V033 |
| `attempted relative import with no known parent package` | The entrypoint's own imports are relative, and it is loaded by path with no parent package; V035 |
| `ModuleNotFoundError` for a distribution this image's own code never imports | The entrypoint's package `__init__` or a sibling imports it; add it to this entry's `requirements:` |
| `SyntaxError` on the workflow's agent import | An `entrypoint` path segment is not a Python identifier; V034 |
| A model call fires at container start, before any request | Module-level code in the entrypoint performs a real run |
| `ModuleNotFoundError` for a submodule that used to exist | An unpinned requirement resolved to a newer major; pin it to what the source resolved |
| `unexpected keyword argument` inside an SDK call | The pinned distribution is newer than the source; pin contemporaneous with the source's commit date |

## Request is accepted, then fails

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| Unexpected keyword argument | yaml argument name differs from adapter parameter name |
| Required argument missing | yaml does not declare a required adapter parameter, or workflow platform sent only `query` |
| Unauthorized service | The first matching policy rule excludes that service |
| `.value()` returns dict-like text | Expected; remote values are strings, so use `json.loads` |
| Object is not JSON serializable | Adapter returned framework objects without its JSON-safe serializer |
| Redis contains a coroutine repr | Adapter method is async and the controller did not await it |
| Fan-out is no faster | Dispatch and `.value()` were fused, serializing the calls |
| Debug block runs at startup | Workflow is executed with `__name__ == "__main__"` |
| `Lock is bound to a different event loop` on the second request | `asyncio.run` per call, while the instance holds loop-bound state; use one persistent background loop |
| Model call reaches the real provider with the proxy configured | The SDK reads a base-URL variable the env file does not set; read [llm-proxy.md](llm-proxy.md) |

## Deployment platform endpoint

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| 404 while workflow container is healthy | Workflow function is not named `main` |
| 400 before host receives request | Body is not the platform's `{query: string}` shape |
| Extra workflow argument is missing | Platform sends only `query`; extra parameters need defaults |

## Cleanup

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| Ctrl+C leaves the deployment running | `canyonos deploy` follows logs; Ctrl+C stops monitoring, not the deployment. Ask before running `canyonos stop` |
| `canyonos clean` succeeds but containers remain | The command removes generated directories only |
| `canyonos clean` succeeds but images remain | Image deletion is separate and requires exact tags |
| Next deployment collides with old resources | The deployment was killed or crashed before controller cleanup |
