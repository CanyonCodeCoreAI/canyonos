# Configure EC2 deployment

**When:** at least one config entry uses `provider: EC2`.

**Output:** developer-supplied EC2 settings, reachable service addresses, and a
safe remote cleanup plan.

## Configuration

Use `provider: EC2` and declare `instance_type` on every EC2 service entry. The
top-level `ec2` block supplies the runtime's required infrastructure and SSH
settings. Read the target checkout's deploy preflight and EC2 runtime before
writing the block; do not copy values from an example environment.

These identifiers come from the developer during the configuration review;
they are the one part of the manifest with no safe default. If the round produces no
answer, leave the entry `provider: local` and report that EC2 was requested but
not configured. Never fill the block from an example, a previous port, or
another entry in the same manifest.

Typical required categories are:

- AMI and instance type
- region and subnet
- security groups
- SSH user and credentials accepted by the runtime

`canyonos deploy` owns basic EC2 config validation. A preflight pass is not proof
that provisioning, SSH, image transfer, or remote container startup works.

## Networking

A remote container's `host.docker.internal` names its own EC2 Docker host. It
does not name the local controller machine. Databases, `otel` destinations, and
other services must use addresses reachable from every selected host. The
`llm_proxy` is not one of them: every container runs its own on
`127.0.0.1:8081` (see [llm-proxy.md](llm-proxy.md)).

The EC2 runtime copies the environment file to the remote host for the
duration of `docker run`, the same way the local runtime passes it. Explicit
`-e` wiring still wins over anything in the file.

## Deployment and cleanup

After the user explicitly approves `canyonos deploy`, verify the remote
container logs; controller health can be green even when agent loading failed.
Do not start a separate build or deployment as part of validation.

Ctrl+C stops CLI log monitoring, not necessarily the deployment. Ask before
running `canyonos stop` so the controller can terminate recorded EC2 instances.
If provisioning or startup fails before an instance is recorded, inspect the
cloud provider directly and remove exact leaked resources. Never use a broad
cleanup command against unrelated instances.
