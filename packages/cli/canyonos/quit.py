"""
Logic for `canyonos quit`: full teardown. Stops and removes the Global
Controller container AND deletes the /workspace named volume, so the project
files copied into it are discarded too. Also tears down the local dashboard
stack (web/api/db), if one was started from this project. (Use `canyonos stop`
to only halt a running deploy while keeping the containers and files around.)
