"""
Logic for `canyonos deploy`: copy the project into the container's /workspace
volume (via `canyonos sync`), then tell the Global Controller container to
build and deploy it. The container's `canyonos deploy` handles both the build
(stubs, protos, Docker images) and the launch -- the CLI just ships files,
triggers it, and watches the logs.

That log stream is mostly noise the user didn't ask for (a whole `docker buildx
bake` transcript, among other things), so by default only the phase transitions
worth seeing are rendered and everything else is dropped. `-v` streams it all,
and a failure reveals the output it had been hiding.

Once the deploy's logs report the workflow is actually up, `canyonos serve`
is kicked off automatically so the local dashboard is ready without an extra
manual step, and the log tail itself stops -- `canyonos logs` re-attaches
to it on demand.
