"""
Logic for `canyonos build`: install the CanyonOS skill on a coding agent,
then launch that agent with a prompt to apply it to the current project.

--agent/--scope/-y replace the two menus, so the command also runs where there
is no tty, and -y is the unattended form whether or not one is attached. The
command's exit status is the port's: the agent can end its session having asked
a question nobody answered, so what the port produced is checked here with
`canyonos validate` rather than taken on trust.
