"""Where every dev-only knob in this CLI is resolved.

One variable decides the mode -- `CANYONOS_ENV`, read once, here -- and no
other module reads the environment itself. Each artifact the CLI pulls from
outside the repo (the Global Controller image, the porting skill, the dashboard
images) gets a small pure resolver below, so the rules are unit-testable and
live in one place.

Every artifact variable takes the same three forms:

    unset / `prod`   the production artifact, i.e. exactly what a released CLI uses
    `local`          the artifact from this checkout
    anything else    taken literally (an image tag, a directory, a git ref)

Overrides are a development affordance: in `production` anything but
unset/`prod` raises rather than quietly shipping a dev artifact to a user.
Developers opt in through `packages/cli/.env`;
shell variables win over that file, and no `.env` at all means production.
