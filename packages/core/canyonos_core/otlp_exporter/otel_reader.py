"""Consumer side of the OTel export queue: the bookkeeping writes the exporter makes as it
drains the SQLite queue -- marking rows sent, flushing, and pruning aged-out rows.

Runs inside the ``otel_exporter`` subprocess. Selecting pending rows is done directly in
``otel_exporter.py``; this module holds the mutations that only the exporter can make,
because only it knows which rows were actually delivered. New rows are written by the
producer (``controller/utils/otel_writer.py``); the two sides share nothing but
``controller/utils/schema.py`` and the database file.
